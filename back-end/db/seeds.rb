transportation = Post.create!(title: "Transportation", 
body: "I live in a suburb in the US where I drive to everywhere. Trying to understand passes/options for transportation is overwhelming.
There will be 6-8 of us. From the Narita airport I think it's cheaper to hire a minivan vs purchasing train tickets.
A week in Tokyo, then a week in Kyoto. Based on someone's suggestion, we decided to stay in Kyoto and take day trips to Osaka vs packing/unpacking and checking in/out.
While in Tokyo, we will do the usual site seeing activities, a day trip to DisneySea, a day trip to Hakone.
While in Kyoto, a few day trips to Osaka, a day trip to Nara, a day trip to Ghibli Park in Nagoya.
We haven't decided but may depart from Osaka because it's slightly higher than purchasing tickets for the shinkansen from Kyoto to Narita airport. Or should I get a pass?
I can use advices on what transportation passes/tickets to purchase. I'm getting confused with when to use JR or Shinkansen. Thank you.",

considering that it will be a festive day, what would you suggest to do as a day trip from Tokyo on January 1st?

Post.create!(title: "First time to Osaka!", 
body: "Hey folks, have bought a flight to Osaka around mid Feb 2023. Understand that is still winter season. Will be staying for about 11 days.

1) Do I need to bring winter clothings like the full set, gloves, scarf, thick jacket, coats etc.. so just a jacket suffice?

2) My flight arrives after 9pm and by the time I pass through immigration and baggage, it could possibly be close to 10pm. And I get overwhelmed easily and may be confused with the train lines and ticketing system. Woild it be better for me to stay overnight at the airport hotel, or still continue to make my way to Osaka station? I intend to stay a hotel connected to the station.

3) in layman terms, what does JR Pass and Icacao card and others provides for me in terms of transport? I know I googled but tbh I'm still very much confused! Should I get all the cards?

4) should I base in Osaka first or Kyoto? And considering I would want to visit nearby cities too for day trips. Any recommendations for cities?

5) in terms of food expenses (and the occasional entrance fees for sights) is budget of 10000 Yen per day sufficient?

Many thanks! Am so excited about this trip because after years and years of dreaming to go Japan, I finally can realized it. :)

things_to_know_before_traveling_to_hawaii = Blog.create!(title: "12 Things to Know Before Traveling to Hawaii", 
body: "One of the joys of visiting Hawaii is the islandsâ pervasive laid-back culture â the lack of pre-planning and freedom from everyday worries is delightful.

Still, you'll have a better visit if you take a few details into consideration before and during your stay. From when to visit and how much to budget to the etiquette surrounding the islands' best beaches and surf breaks, here are some key things to know about traveling to the 50th US state.

Make the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.
1. Decide the best time to go
You can visit Hawaii anytime â the weather is agreeable year-round. It may be a bit rainier in winter and a bit hotter in summer, but there are no extremes because cooling trade winds blow throughout the year.

Although winter (mid-December through mid-April) is the busiest tourist season, that has more to do with the climate elsewhere, as many tourists are snowbirds escaping cold weather back home. Crowds of families take summer vacations from June through August, and rooms are scarce and prices can spike around holidays, especially Thanksgiving, Christmas, New Yearâs and spring break/Easter.

For the budget-conscious, the slowest times are mid-September through mid-November and the weeks from just after Easter until Memorial Day at the end of May, and youâre more likely to find good deals then on accommodations and airfare. Surfers will find the largest waves in winter, while optimal windsurfing conditions are during summer. Whale-watching tours usually depart between January and March only. 


2. You'll need to make some reservations in advance
Although Hawaiiâs hang-loose attitude extends to most facets of life â including making extensive plans in advance â  you might want to book ahead in a couple of instances. For top Honolulu restaurants popular with residents, reserve a table before you arrive in the islands. The free tickets for the boat to the USS Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor are scooped up quickly. Reserve online up to 60 days before your visit.

3. Respect Hawaiian culture
Evolving from ancient Polynesian traditions, Hawaiian culture was attacked and suppressed in the two centuries after the arrival of British colonizer Captain Cook in 1778. But beginning with the Hawaiian Renaissance in the 1970s, a rebirth of Native Hawaiian cultural and artistic traditions has taken hold.

Across the islands, both Hawaiian cultureâfocused charter schools and public schools' Hawaiian-language immersion programs are popular, and traditional arts are experiencing a revival. Ancient heiau (temples) and fishponds are being restored, native forests replanted and endangered birds bred and released back into the wild. 

Today Hawaiian culture is about much more than just melodic place names and luau shows. Being Hawaiian is an important part of the identity of the islands, reflected in ways both large and small, from the inclusion of Hawaiian words in everyday speech to the embrace of concepts of respect and inclusion. Although few island residents can agree on what shape the Hawaiian sovereignty movement should take, its grassroots political activism is increasingly part of the local dialogue.

Dos and don'ts in Hawaii

Good manners in Hawaii revolve around respect and awareness.

Do use aloha (hello/goodbye and the concept of love and fellowship) and mahalo (thank you). Liberally wave the shaka (Hawaiiâs hand greeting sign).
Do try to correctly pronounce Hawaiian place names and words. Even if you fail, the attempt is appreciated. If you arenât sure how to say it, ask. Even long names arenât that hard with a little practice.
Donât refer to Maui, KauaÊ»i, MolokaÊ»i, LanaÊ»i and HawaiÊ»i (the Big Island) as 'outer islands' â it's OÊ»ahu-centric. Theyâre called 'Neighbor Islands.''
Donât try to speak pidgin â unless youâre really good at it.
Do ask permission before you pick fruit or flowers from trees on private property.
Donât be pushy. Youâll get what you want (this time), but youâll get no aloha with it.
Do drive slowly. Residents rarely have far to go, and they drive that way. In fact, do everything slowly.
Donât freak out at every gecko and cockroach. Itâs the tropics. There are critters.
Donât collect (or even move) stones at sacred sites. If youâre not sure whether somethingâs sacred, consider that in Hawaiian thinking, everything is sacred, especially in nature.
Donât stack rocks or wrap them in ti leaves at waterfalls or heiau. This is an adulteration of the Hawaiian practice of leaving hoÊ»okupu (offerings) at sacred sites â and itâs littering the islandsâ fragile environment.
Donât get naked (or topless) on the beach unless itâs an unofficial clothing-optional beach. As always, follow the lead of residents.
4. Underdress for success
The casual Hawaii dress code means that T-shirts and flip-flops are ubiquitous, except at Honoluluâs top-tier restaurants and at high-end resorts across the islands. Going fancy means neat, modest attire, which for men usually just means an aloha shirt and slacks.

5. Know your Ê»okina
The Ê»okina punctuation mark (Ê») is the Hawaiian languageâs glottal stop, which determines the pronunciation and meaning of words. Increasingly, HawaiÊ»i (with the Ê»okina) is being used for the island of HawaiÊ»i (the Big Island), for references to ancient HawaiÊ»i and to the Kingdom of HawaiÊ»i pre-statehood. Hawaii (without the Ê»okina) refers to the US territory that became a state in 1959, although the spelling with the Ê»okina is being used for the state and place name more and more.

6. Learn the local surfing etiquette
Residents are usually willing to share surf spots that have become popular tourist destinations, but they reserve the right to protect other 'secret' surf grounds. As a newbie in the lineup, donât expect to get every wave that comes your way. Thereâs a definite pecking order, and frankly, tourists are at the bottom. That being said, usually if you give a wave, youâll get a wave in return. Be generous in the water, understand your place and surf with a smile. At famous breaks where surfers can be ferociously territorial, such as OÊ»ahuâs Banzai Pipeline, ask a local for an introduction. 

7. Be aware of floods
No matter how dry a streambed looks or how sunny the sky above might be, a sudden rainstorm miles away can cause a flash flood in minutes, sending down a huge surge of debris-filled water that sweeps away everything in its path. Always check the weather report before setting out on a hike; this is crucial if youâre planning on hiking through any narrow canyons or swimming in waterfalls or natural pools.

8. Protect your belongings
The islands are notorious for thefts from parked cars, especially rentals (which are obviously tagged with barcode stickers). Thieves can pop a trunk or pull out a door-lock assembly within seconds. They strike not only at trailheads when youâve gone for a hike, but also at crowded beach and hotel parking lots where youâd expect safety in numbers. 

Do not leave anything valuable in your parked car, ever. If you must do so, then pack all valuables out of sight before arriving at your destination; thieves lurk about to see what you put in the trunk.

9. Stay aware of your surroundings
Stay attuned to the vibe on any beaches at night, even where police patrols are present (eg Waikiki), and in places like campgrounds and roadside county parks, where drug users and gang members sometimes hang out. In rural areas of the islands, there may be pockets of resentment against tourists, so be respectful as you explore off the beaten path. 

10. Avoid scams
The main scams directed toward visitors involve fake activity-operator booths and timeshare booths. Salespeople at the latter will offer you all sorts of deals, from free luaus to sunset cruises, if youâll just come to hear their 'no obligation' pitch. Caveat emptor. 

11. Donât trespass
Hawaii has strict laws about trespassing on both private land and government land not intended for public use. Trespassing is always illegal, no matter how many other people you see doing it. As a visitor to the islands, itâs important to respect all 'Kapu' or 'No Trespassing' signs. Always seek explicit permission from the landowner or local officials before venturing onto private or government-owned land that is closed to the public, regardless of whether it is fenced or signposted as such.

12. Watch out for jellyfish
Stings from box jellyfish and Portuguese man-of-war (aka bluebottles) occur in Hawaiiâs tropical waters. Even touching a bluebottle hours after it has washed up onshore can result in burning stings.

Box jellyfish are often seen seven to 10 days after a full moon, when they float into Hawaiiâs shallow near-shore waters, such as those at Waikiki. When this happens, some public beaches may be closed for safety. The Waikiki Aquarium has a calendar that predicts the presence of box jellyfish.",

body: "

The idea of winter in Europe is not so bad: frosty forest trails, snow-capped mountains and mulled wine at Christmas markets all sound lovely. But after months of gloomy clouds, biting winds and grey sludge with a side of hail, we canât blame you for dreaming of a warmer getaway.

Luckily, you donât have to go far: Europeâs southern reaches can provide plenty of blue skies, sunshine and mild (albeit not tropical) temperatures year-round. Whatâs more, traveling in the low season means accommodation and car rental can be gloriously cheap, while beaches and local attractions are crowd-free.

Here are the best and sunniest spots for a European winter vacation. Feel your toes thawing out already?

Forge new connections on your next adventure with the latest advice from our weekly newsletter.

1. Malta
Discover green countryside, culture and history 

Malta can be scorching in summer, so the cooler days of winter (with temperatures rarely below 50Â°F/10Â°C) are perfect for exploring the great outdoors. Rock climbing and hiking are particularly pleasant in the off season, as the rural landscape is at its greenest. Culture and history buffs should catch a winter-solstice sunrise on December 21 at Mnajdra Temple, where the sun accurately lights up the edges of a megalith. And the Maltese Carnival in February promises parades and late-night parties.

Rainy-day rescue: If you need to seek shelter, choose a space that shimmers. The baroque interior of St Johnâs Co-Cathedral in Unesco-listed Valletta offers a dazzling way to ride out a rain shower.

2. Cyprus
Revel in the Mediterraneanâs warmest winter 

With more than 340 days of sunshine a year, Cyprus is your best bet for a warm winter in the Mediterranean. While snow glitters on the peaks of the TroÃ¶dos mountains (skiers, take note), coastal areas, particularly in the east, stay warmer and drier. Stay in Larnaka to spot flamingos dancing around their winter home on the nearby salt lake before heading west for historic treasures such as the Tombs of the Kings and Ancient Kourion.

Rainy-day rescue: Spend a wet afternoon among the ancient artifacts of the Cyprus Museum in Nicosia, or find a cozy taverna for a long Cypriot feast.

3. The Algarve, Portugal
Soak up more than 300 days of sunshine a year

The Algarve is an increasingly popular winter sun destination, with its more than 300 days of sunshine a year and 87 blue-flag beaches. Winter brings waterfalls to life in the eucalyptus-filled Monchique Mountains. Migrating birds flock to Ria Formosa Natural Park. And popular Quinta do Lago Beach is blissfully quiet. If you can handle sea temperatures of 57Â°F (14Â°C), now is the time to surf â while golfers are spoiled for choice, too. Work up an appetite before finding dinner in the whitewashed towns of Faro, Lagos or Tavira.

4. Crete, Greece
Have deserted resort towns all to yourself

In winter youâll need to fly via Athens to reach Crete. While many resort towns will be pretty much deserted, you can base yourself in Heraklion or Haania for a sense of low-season life (and the chance to find open restaurants) before hiring a bargain rental car for an island road trip. On sunny days you might find you have the pink-tinged sands of Elafonisi or the Palace of Knossos all to yourself. Temperatures can reach highs of 61Â°F (16Â°C) in January, but the nights are much colder, so pack layers. Still chilly? An evening with a bottle of local raki should warm you up nicely.

Rainy-day rescue: Uncover five millennia of history at Heraklion Archaeological Museum, one of the best museums in Greece.

5. Sicily, Italy
Retrace season two of The White Lotus, location by location

If you binged The White Lotus, you can explore stunning Sicily the same way the cast of the second season did: in the off-season. (The cast and crew took over the deluxe San Domenico Palace hotel in Taormina for much of the winter and spring of 2022.) Winter is indeed a colorful season on this magical island: citrus trees are heavy with ripening oranges, lemons and limes; food market stalls in Catania and Palermo creak under the weight of fresh vegetables, fish and seasonal walnuts; and all over the island people are preparing for Carnevale (which takes place this year on February 19). While the weather can change at the drop of a blood orange, eight hours of sunshine a day and average highs reaching double those in London make it worth taking your chances.

Rainy-day rescue: Villa Romana del Casale is home to the most significant collection of Roman floor mosaics in the world â and the wooden roof protects them (and you) from the elements.

6. Seville, Spain
Immerse yourself in MudÃ©jar style, and sunshine

If you want a winter city break, look no further than Seville. Temperatures often rise to 63Â°F (17Â°C), with at least six hours of sunshine a day (though packing an umbrella is always wise). Top sights like the Plaza de Espana and the Real AlcÃ¡zar feature indoor areas and outdoor delights, allowing you bask in the sunshine and hide from a passing shower. Enjoy a sunset stroll along the modern Metropol Parasol, known locally as Las Setas.

Rainy-day rescue: Take a tour of Sevilleâs stunning Cathedral, or stamp, tap and shimmy through the Flamenco Dance Museum, where you can also arrange a lesson or watch the pros perform.

7. Madeira, Portugal
Here, itâs always âeternal springâ

An island region of Portugal north of the Canaries, Madeira is known for its âeternal spring.â Mild winters are standard, with temperatures rarely dropping below 57Â°F (14Â°C). Beaches are rocky but the sea is warm, so pack your swimsuit â or join a dolphin- and whale-spotting tour. If you prefer dry land, Madeiraâs rugged interior is ideal for hiking. Follow a trail along a levada â an ancient network of channels that distributed water around the island for over a century that are these days sources of hydropower.

Rainy-day rescue: Relax with afternoon tea while watching the rain fall. Belmond Reidâs Palace in Funchal has welcomed Winston Churchill and Roger Moore (aka James Bond) in its time â why not you, too?

8. Turquoise Coast, Turkey
Admire the crystal-clear waters â without the crowds

Turkeyâs Turquoise Coast is a tourist magnet in summer â perhaps it has something to do with the shade of that water â but when the crowds have dispersed, thereâs nothing but you, those views and an average of 10 hours of sunshine a day. Moderate temperatures mean hiking is nowhere near as sweaty as it would be in August â so why not tackle some of the 335-mile (540km) Lycian Way? The route winds between Fethiye and Antalya, passing countless ancient ruins and clifftop wonders including the Levissi ruins, ancient Patara and the (mostly) sunken city of Simena.

Rainy-day rescue: Warm up, give your legs a rest and enjoy a treatment at a hammam (Turkish bath), found in most major towns.

9. Balearic Islands, Spain
Frolic on epic beaches and watch peerless sunsets

Spainâs islands are adored by summer holiday makers but are just as lovable come winter. The pumping beats and party crowds in Ibiza have left â but the epic sunsets and beaches remain. Culture-packed Mallorca, meanwhile, is quieter and cheaper. Lesser-visited Menorca lures nature fans with walker-friendly weather and the CamÃ­ de Cavalls coastal path, while tiny Formentera beckons those who want true seclusion.

Rainy-day rescue: If youâre going to get wet, you may as well go diving. Sea temperatures allow for diving around the Balearicsâ caverns and shipwrecks year-round.

10. Canary Islands, Spain
Take to the waves, dunes and hidden coves

Want sand dunes and hidden coves, volcanic national parks and forested mountains? How about colorful villages, tempting restaurants and watersports galore? Itâs all here, all year. Tenerife and Gran Canaria are generally the warmest of the islands in winter with highs around 71Â°F (22Â°C). Lanzarote and Fuerteventura can be a little windy â which isnât necessarily a bad thing if youâre heading there to surf.

body: "Adamâs Peak, Sri Lanka
Stairs leading to sunrise magic 
Start/end at Dalhousie; 9 miles (14km) round trip; more info

In world terms, this conical Sri Lankan mountain isnât all that high at only 7360ft (2243m) â but donât let its size fool you. Itâs a punishing climb, favored by pilgrims who come to see the Sri Pada, or sacred footprint, said to have been left by either Buddha, Shiva or Adam, depending on which religion you happen to belong to.

There are six possible routes to the top, and the one most often used by trekkers is the Hatton Trail, a steep uphill slog involving numerous stairs cut into the mountain. To get there in time for sunrise requires both an early start and a hand from the weather gods: Sri Lankaâs jungly terrain means the peak is (unfortunately) often enveloped in clouds. Yet with luck, at the top youâll have a memorable view encompassing the islandâs west, south and east coasts.

Tateyama-KamikÅchi hike, Japan 
A Japanese classic
Start at Murodo, end at KamikÅchi; 40 miles (65km); more info

The classic hike covering the length of Japanâs North Alps takes around seven days in the most spectacular alpine scenery the country has to offer. This hike starts at Murodo (8040ft/2450m), the high point on the enthralling Tateyama-Kurobe Alpine Route, which links the western and eastern sides of the North Alps with a series of cable cars, buses, trolley buses through tunnels and a walk over the Kurobe Dam.

Climb the sacred peak of Tateyama (9890ft/3015m), then head south to climb spear-like Yarigatake (10,430ft/3180m) and Oku-Hotaka-dake (10,470ft/3190m), before dropping into the remote resort village of KamikÅchi (4920ft/1500m). Mountain huts with bedding and meals along the way mean you can take minimal gear; youâll also find a number of camping areas. In the four days between Tateyama and Yarigatake youâll likely see fewer people than on one Tokyo rush-hour subway carriage.

Explore North Africaâs highest peak
Start/end at Imlil; 45 miles (72km)

The apex of the Atlas range, 13,671ft (4167m) Mt Toubkal is also the highest peak in all of North Africa. You can get up and down the mountain in two days if summiting is all that matters â though making a longer circuit not only helps with acclimatization, but also offers a greater insight into local Berber culture.

From the Imlil valley, youâll make a clockwise loop via walnut groves and cherry orchards, high passes and boulder fields, mud-brick houses and neat green terraces, wandering shepherds and wind-wizened juniper trees. The final ascent from the Neltner refuge is a stiff but steady clamber up scree, rewarded by views across a starkly spectacular landscape that the hardy Berber have made their own.

Gorilla tracking in Bwindi, Uganda
A hike in search of incredible creatures
Start/end depends on the gorilla family being tracked, but treks usually depart from park headquarters; various distances; habituation-experience permits cost $1500 per person; more info

The total population of mountain gorillas is tiny: fewer than 900 are believed to survive in the Virunga Mountains straddling DR Congo, Rwanda and Uganda, and in the last countryâs Bwindi Impenetrable Forest. Whacking up through the lush, dense vegetation of Bwindi to locate one of the habituated family groups is not for softies: itâs steep, itâs muddy, itâs overgrown, and it can be wet, cold, hot â or all three in one day. Until recently, limited numbers of permits costing $600 per person allowed visitors to spend up to one hour with a family (if you can find them). But you can now join rangers habituating new groups, and enjoy gorilla company for several hours.

A Great Walk to see birdlife 
Start at Lee Bay, end at Fern Gully (or the reverse); 20 miles (32 km); more info

Stewart Islandâs kiwis (the southern brown kiwi) may be extra large, but that doesnât mean that theyâre any easier to spot. Youâll have to wait until dusk, then head for Ocean Beach in the Glory Cove Scenic Reserve, giving the protected sea lions a wide berth. Since youâll need a permit to be there after 6pm, itâs worth joining a guided tour.

Yet the Rakiura Great Walk on Stewart Island offers almost-certain sightings of lots of New Zealand birdlife, including kaka parrots, bellbirds, tui, fantails, little blue penguins and an abundance of wading birds. The 20-mile (32 km) circuit starts near the Rakiura National Park visitor center on the east coast of this island, which sits just below the South Island. The walk typically takes three days; youâll need to book huts in advance.

Arctic Circle Trail, Greenland 
An Arctic journey 
Start at Kangerlussuaq, finish at Sisimiut; 100 miles (160km); seven to 10 days; more info

At the northern edge of the planet, Greenlandâs Arctic Circle Trail reaches across a landscape devoid of towns and cars: this is the domain of reindeer, musk oxen and Arctic foxes. Hikers will find nine free-to-use huts along the way; between each stop, youâll take in solitary views of serene lakes, rushing streams and domed mountains. While most hikers tackle the trail in the summer to take advantage of the midnight sun, a winter excursion has its own charms: uninterrupted views of the ethereal Northern Lights and the chance to travel by dogsled. If youâd like to add a little extra adventure, continue past Kangerlussuaq to Russell Glacier, which flows from the Greenland ice sheet.

El Mirador, Guatemala
Find ancient history in the jungle 
Start/finish at Carmelita; 25 miles (40km); five to six days; guided tours only

The dense jungles in Guatemala are filled with overgrown Mayan ruins and archaeological sites. During a five- or six-day guided trek through this region, hikers will be challenged when tackling the unique rainforest terrain and camping beneath the canopy. Howler monkeys, tropical birds and possibly jaguars can be spotted as hikers explore sites including El Mirador as they learn more about the Maya civilization. While the hiking is relatively flat and the trails are well maintained, the jungle always presents unexpected obstacles to overcome. Hiking can last for upward of eight hours each day, not including climbing up and down all the stone ruins â so only those in excellent shape should attempt this tough but thrilling expedition.

Florida National Scenic Trail, Florida, USA 
See Floridaâs wild side
Start/end at either Big Cypress National Preserve or Fort Pickens, Gulf Islands National Seashore; 1300 miles (2090km) 

Far from fairy-tale castles or friendly mice, explore the alternative Sunshine State: that is, its estimable wild side. The Florida National Scenic Trail (about three-quarters complete) begins in the Panhandle, on the crunchy-white, turquoise-lapped beaches of the Gulf Islands National Seashore near Pensacola. From here, it wiggles east and south, via salt marshes, crystal-clear springs, lakes, prairies, old-growth forests and historic urban areas. It finishes in Big Cypress National Preserve, bordering the Everglades, amid a lush swampland of bright bromeliads and giant ferns. This semi-tropical state is incredibly bio-diverse, and most of the trail is also a wildlife corridor, protecting both common and rare species. Possible sightings include black bears, deer, otters, alligators, gopher tortoises and sea turtles. A plethora of birds, too: the crested caracara and red-cockaded woodpecker are particularly sought-after species.",

how_to_get_around_in_zurich = Blog.create!(title: "How to get around in Zurich", 
body: "Despite being Switzerlandâs largest city, ZÃ¼rich is a compact place with many pedestrian areas, making it ripe for exploration on foot. However, as befits a Swiss metropolis, its public transport network is highly organized and runs like clockwork.

Here's our guide to getting around ZÃ¼rich, whether by S-Bahn train, tram, bus, ferry, bicycle or scooter, a seamlessly interconnected network which will take you from the cobbled hills of the Altstadt (Old Town) to the popular nightlife zone of ZÃ¼ri West to the cityâs local mountain Uetliberg.

Get local insight on destinations all over the world with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.
Travel like a local on an electric tram
ZÃ¼rich has had electric trams since the late-19th century, and todayâs modern incarnations are the most visible symbols of the cityâs efficient public transport system.

Clean, spacious and extremely regular, they serve most parts of central ZÃ¼rich, from the nightspots and cultural venues of ZÃ¼rich West to the shopping district around Bahnhofstrasse (the opera house on Lake ZÃ¼richâs right bank) and even out to the airport (though itâs quicker to get there on the S-Bahn).

And where trams donât venture â for example down the quaysides along the lake â buses fill in, making for a highly connected network, all coordinated and ticketed by the ZÃ¼rich Transport Association (ZVV).

Ride the S-Bahn to Uetliberg
For longer journeys in and around ZÃ¼rich, swift and punctual service is provided by the comprehensive S-Bahn network, which has been expanded four times since its launch in 1990.

From the Hauptbahnhof (main train station), S-Bahn trains leave for destinations including Schaffhausen and the Rheinfall, the pretty medieval village of Rapperswil at the southern end of Lake ZÃ¼rich (to which you could ride the ferry instead, if you have the time) and the culture-packed city of Winterthur.

For an easy day trip, jump on the S10 for Uetliberg, ZÃ¼richâs so-called local mountain, and within half an hour youâll be strolling through nature at an altitude of 871m (2858ft), overlooking the city down below.

Tour Lake ZÃ¼rich by boat
ZÃ¼rich hugs the northern end of its eponymous lake and is divided in two by the Limmat River. Both waterways add hugely to the cityâs identity, lifestyle and navigability, not to mention its picture-postcard appearance.

Get your bearings by hopping on one of the ferries run by the Lake ZÃ¼rich Navigation Company (ZSG), which offers river cruises â round trips to destinations around the lake â as well as so-called 'unique cruises,' which let you enjoy a fondue, a burger or even a silent disco as you sail.

Pedal through the city on a free bike
ZÃ¼rich is pretty cycle-friendly already, though the city authorities are aiming to make it even more so with their Velo Strategy 2030, a master plan involving building new bike lanes, riverside cycle paths and parking stations throughout the city.

If you donât have your own bike, ZÃ¼ri Rollt can lend you one for free with a returnable deposit of 20chf. The company has two pick-up points, at the Hauptbahnhof and at Pestalozziwiese. Choose your bike (or e-bike, available for a small fee) and head off to explore the city on two wheels.

For a lovely day trip, cycle all the way to Baden on the path alongside the Limmat River â a pleasant, mostly flat 28km (92-mile) route with multiple picnic spots â before putting yourself and your bike on the train back to ZÃ¼rich.

Zip through ZÃ¼ri on an electric scooter
ZÃ¼rich has fully embraced the electric-scooter trend. Multiple companies, including Voi, Bolt and Lime, offer on-street scooter hire.

Track down a free-floating scooter (youâll see them seemingly abandoned all over the place) on your chosen providerâs app, then scan it, attach your phone to the holder, and youâre free to zip about the city as you please. Itâs a convenient way to get from A to B, if a little pricey for regular use.

Hop on the Polybahn for a city panorama
Founded in 1886, the little red funicular known as the Polybahn is a ZÃ¼rich icon (and essentially a way for students to avoid walking up a hill). It takes a little more than a minute and a half to ascend from the Limmatquai to the Polyterrasse at ETH ZÃ¼rich, the famed Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.

The view from the top takes in the streets of Niederdorf, the Limmat River and the Old Town over the other side, along with ZÃ¼richâs twin churches, the FraumÃ¼nster and GrossmÃ¼nster.


Accessible transportation in ZÃ¼rich
ZÃ¼richâs public transport network is generally well adapted for people with reduced mobility, with lowerable-floor buses, barrier-free stations and step-free trams and S-Bahn trains. Ticket machines are adapted for the visually impaired, while stations and platforms have raised white safety lines.

All ferries on Lake ZÃ¼rich are wheelchair accessible (though not the river boats) and most have disabled passenger toilets. The Polybahn is not adapted for wheelchair users. Full details of accessible travel in ZÃ¼rich are available on the ZVV website.

For more information, see Lonely Planetâs Accessible Travel Resources page.

Transport passes
The cityâs public-transport overlord, the ZÃ¼rich Transport Association (ZVV), offers an integrated ticketing system across all forms of transport in ZÃ¼rich, including the Polybahn and scheduled ZSG boat services (but excluding the unique cruises).

Single and multiple tickets can be bought on the smartphone app, online or at ticket machines and are valid on any form of public transport within the selected zone. The 24-hour ticket offers the best value for a whole day of travel (fares vary depending on the zones required).

If youâre planning on visiting more than a couple of the cityâs museums, it may make sense to buy a ZÃ¼rich Card, provided by ZÃ¼rich Tourism and available to buy from ticket machines. Valid for 24 or 72 hours, it includes entrance to many museums and second-class travel across the public transport network, plus various discounts and offers. Donât forget to validate your ZÃ¼rich Card at a ticket machine before you use it for the first time.",

montanas_best_winter_activities = Blog.create!(title: "Montana's best winter activities - that aren't all skiing", 
body: "Winter in Montana is a harsh but magical season. A winter hush descends upon a landscape so cold that even sound seems frozen. But for those well equipped and with a certain level of experience, Montana offers incredible ways to get out and explore its stunningly beautiful mountain terrain.

Whitefish and the surrounding Flathead Valley is unbeatable for almost every kind of winter activity, as is the Gallatin Valley between Big Sky and West Yellowstone. For pristine backcountry skiing and snowmobiling, plus access to Yellowstone National Park, remote Cooke City is a great in-the-know destination.

Explore the planet's most surprising adventures with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.
1. Snowshoe, ski and spot wolves in Yellowstone National Park
Winter is many people's favorite season to visit Yellowstone National Park. There are almost no crowds, the geysers are at their steamiest and the frozen landscapes are simply stunning.

Yellowstone National Park has two main areas to visit in winter. From West Yellowstone, snowcoach tours shuttle to Old Faithful, from where you can make ski or snowshoe excursions around the park's geyser basins, before a hot chocolate and overnight at the cozy Snow Lodge.

Further north, the park entrance at Gardiner and its road to Cooke City are the only ones open to cars during winter. This opens up a host of snowshoe and cross-country ski trailheads around the Mammoth region, some of which are served by snowcoach drops.

Planning Tip: The wildlife spotting in Yellowstone is legendary in winter because it's easier to spot animals against the white background. For an unforgettable opportunity to lock eyes with a Yellowstone wolf, sign up for a wildlife-spotting trip with an expert local company like Yellowstone Wolf Tracker.

2. Snowmobile the Targhee or Flathead National Forests
It may not be the most environmentally friendly activity (with access to places like Yellowstone National Park long mired in controversy), but if you are a confident rider, there's no more exciting way to traverse Montana's epic scenery than on a snowmobile.

Cooke City is one of the most remote towns in Montana, with only one access road in winter (through Yellowstone National Park), but once you get there, the snowmobiling is incredible. Rentals and guides are available in town, and groomed Forest Service roads climb to passes that offer astonishing views of the powder-filled Beartooth Mountains.

As the gateway for winter trips into Yellowstone, West Yellowstone is also well set up for snowmobilers, who can choose from hundreds of miles of spectacular trails in the nearby Targhee National Forest.

Other must-ride locations include the 250 miles of trails at Lolo Pass in the Bitterroot Mountains southwest of Missoula, or the Flathead National Forest near Glacier National Park, where you can rent snowmobiles or join a tour with Swan Mountain Snowmobiling.

3. Watch the curious sport of skijoring
Combine Montana's cowboy heritage with its Norwegian immigrant history and you get skijoring, in which a skier is towed by a horse over a series of jumps and through slaloms at speeds of up to 40mph. It's the kind of sport that feels like it was invented during a night of heavy drinking. Expect high adrenaline and some slightly silly action.

Planning Tip: For spectators the best action is to be found at Whitefish's World Skijoring Invitational in January or at West Yellowstone's National Championship in February. Alternatively, try Big Sky's Best of the West competition in the same month or the skijoring finals held during Red Lodge's Winter Fest in early March.

4. Ski untrammeled slopes from a backcountry yurt or hut
Montana has some mind-blowing backcountry skiing, but it's the kind of terrain reserved for experienced skiers, and it doesn't come cheap. That said, it's an unforgettable experience to ski powder-filled slopes all day, only to return to your private wilderness accommodations miles from civilization.

Several companies offer backcountry accommodations and guides. You can base yourself in cozy yurts with Yurtski in the Swan Mountains, with Big Sky Backcountry Guides in the Bitterroot Mountains or with Beartooth Powder Guides in Cooke City. All offer a range of avalanche and backcountry skiing courses, which are a wise investment.

Hellroaring Powder Guides has both unguided and guided backcountry skiing from their hut in the Centennial Mountains, 25 miles from West Yellowstone.

Great Northern Powder Guides in the Whitefish region offers the only Cat skiing in the state, using their 14-person cabin as a base for incredible, pristine descents.

Planning Tip: The cheapest way to do some gentler cross-country backcountry skiing is to hire a Forest Service Cabin. For $65 you can get a basic cabin for four, though you'll need to chop wood and pack in all your food.

5. Learn how to mush on a dog sled trip
It's hard to think of a more romantic way to traverse Montana's snow-draped winter forests and valleys than in a dog-powered sled. Apart from the thrill of the scenery and learning how to mush, getting to interact with the dogs is a highlight in itself.

Several outfitters offer hands-on dog sledding trips. In western Montana, try Base Camp Bigfork in the Flathead Valley, Winter Woods Dog Sled Tours outside Whitefish or nearby Dog Sled Adventures. Closer to Bozeman, check out Yellowstone Dog Sled Adventures in the southern Gallatin Valley or Spirit of the North Dog Sled Adventures in Big Sky.

6. Try out fat biking on the Whitefish Trail
A fat bike is essentially a mountain bike equipped with chunky double-width tires for riding on packed snow. The increasingly popular sport extends the biking season, opens up whole swatches of winter terrain to non-skiers and allows you to push your riding. Don't worry about wiping out â the snow will cushion your fall.

The 22-mile Whitefish Trail is one of the best places for snow biking in the state. The trailside Whitefish Bike Retreat, 9 miles west of Whitefish, offers fat bike rentals, groomed trail access and accommodations, plus lots of trail advice and occasional three-day fat biking clinics.

Montana's big sky will take your breath away
7. Ski the Going-to-the-Sun Road in Glacier National Park
Montana has an almost unlimited choice of Nordic trails across the state. West Yellowstone, Bozeman, Big Sky, Missoula, Red Lodge and Great Falls all offer Nordic ski centers with plentiful groomed trails. In Whitefish, try the Glacier Nordic Center or Big Mountain Nordic Trails, the latter best suited to more experienced skiers.

For something special, visit Glacier National Park in winter. Most park roads and accommodations close in winter, but you can ski or snowshoe from Lake McDonald Lodge near Apgar on the western side of the park, or along the Going-to-the-Sun Road from St Mary on the eastern side. Remote wilderness trails lead into the park from Polebridge ranger station and Marias Pass.",

five_of_the_best_roadtrips_in_argentina = Blog.create!(title: "5 of the best road trips in Argentina", 
body: "With its vast open spaces, dramatic and diverse scenery and endless highways, Argentina is an ideal place for a road trip.

Hiring a car allows you to escape the crowds, explore at your own pace and visit remote areas that would otherwise be out of reach. Although Argentinaâs main highways are generally paved, you can expect gravel and potholes on many minor roads, particularly in the south, though this just adds to the adventure. Roads off the beaten track are best tackled in spring or summer, avoiding the bitter cold and snows of the South American winter.

For Argentina's most rugged routes, you'll need a 4WD, but there are also plenty of laid-back day trips on sealed roads visiting historic sites, vineyards and viewpoints in some of the most scenic parts of the country.

Whether youâre looking for legendary routes such as the Pan-American Highway or little-known back roads through the wilds, Argentina has you covered. Here are five of our favorite road trips.

Scout new ways to explore the planet's wildest places with our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.

1. Ruta 40
Best route for epic adventure
Cabo VirgenesâLa Quiaca; 5224km (3246 miles); allow 3â5 weeks

Argentinaâs answer to Route 66, Ruta 40 is one of the worldâs longest roads, stretching almost the entire length of Argentina. Also known as RN40, Ruta Nacional Cuarenta or simply La Cuarenta (âThe Fortyâ), this epic highway starts in the far south in Cabo Virgenes, a windswept settlement on the Strait of Magellan, and finishes in the extreme northwest in the town of La Quiaca, which sits at a breathless 3442m (11,293ft) above sea level on the Bolivian border.

Between these two outposts, the highway traces the Andes, passing through 11 Argentinian provinces and scores of stunning landscapes, from vast canyons and rugged mountain passes to temperate rainforests and lush valleys cloaked in vineyards.

The quietest, and perhaps most atmospheric, section of the road runs from El Calafate, a touristy hub for outdoor activities on the edge of Parque Nacional Los Glaciares, to the city of Bariloche in the Argentinian Lake District. For most of this leg of the journey, you'll largely have the road to yourself, with snowy Andean peaks to the west and the seemingly endless Patagonian steppe to the east.

Planning tip: The route is best attempted by experienced motorists in the spring or summer. Ruta 40 is now mostly paved, but it's useful to have a 4WD, particularly if you plan to explore some of the gravel roads (known locally as ripio) that branch off into remote areas of Patagonia.

2. The Pan-American Highway
Best long-distance road trip
MendozaâUshuaia; 3300km (2051 miles); allow 2â4 weeks

A network of interconnected routes snaking right down through the Americas from northern Alaska to Tierra del Fuego, the 3000km (19,000-mile) Pan-American Highway is, quite simply, the worldâs most epic road trip. But there's no need to follow the entire route â the southernmost section in Argentina is a highly memorable drive that takes in many of the countryâs highlights.

The route starts in Mendoza province, the heart of the countryâs famed wine industry, before heading east to the bright lights of the capital, Buenos Aires. Beyond the sprawling suburbs, the highway continues south, skirting the fertile grasslands of the Pampas, tracing the Atlantic coast, and then arrowing through sparsely populated Patagonia.

When you reach the far south, cut into Chile and take a ferry across the Strait of Magellan (this short hop is one of just two stretches of the Pan-American Highway that cannot be driven, alongside the DariÃ©n Gap dividing Panama from Colombia). Itâs then a relatively short drive to the city of Ushuaia, where ubiquitous signs let you know youâve reached 'El Fin del Mundo' (The End of the World).

Planning tip: Although the Argentinian section of the Pan-American Highway can be driven year-round, the bitterly cold, snowy and windy winters in southern Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego mean a summer or spring journey is the best bet. Itâs also important to make sure your car rental agreement and insurance allow you to cross into Chile (you may have to pay an extra fee for this).

3. Cuesta del Obispo route
Best for mountain views
SaltaâCachi; 160km (99 miles); allow 1â2 days

This drive from the charming city of Salta to the tranquil town of Cachi showcases the dramatic mountain landscapes of Argentinaâs northwest. Heading southwest from Salta along RP33 â a largely paved provincial road â the route travels through the sunny CalchaquÃ­ Valley region, which is carpeted with high-altitude vineyards and dotted with clusters of attractive adobe houses.

The journey then continues over a precipitous mountain pass known as the Cuesta del Obispo (âBishopâs Slopeâ), which features a dizzying series of switchback turns, before dropping into Parque Nacional Los Cardones, named for the tall cacti that stud this arid area.

Planning tip: Check the weather forecast before setting out along the Cuesta del Obispo route, as heavy rain can make it impassable. Although you can head back to Salta the same day, itâs well worth spending the night in beautiful Cachi, which is encircled by snowy peaks and set within striking distance of several wineries. Take time to relax and enjoy a few glasses of the regionâs signature torrontÃ©s â an aromatic, peach-fragranced white wine â while soaking up the views.

4. Camino de la Historia
Best historic drive
CÃ³rdobaâCerro Colorado; 170km (106 miles); allow 2â3 days

Often overlooked by travelers, CÃ³rdoba province provides some fascinating insights into the history of the indigenous peoples who originally inhabited this area, as well as the Spanish colonists who came later. Start in the city of CÃ³rdoba, founded in 1573 and known for its rich cultural scene.

The first section of the RN9 highway has been dubbed the Camino de la Historia ('Historical Route'), and it follows the colonial-era Camino Real del PerÃº (âRoyal Road of Peruâ), which once ran from Lima to Buenos Aires via the legendary silver mines of PotosÃ­ in present-day Bolivia.

On the way, you'll pass the evocative estancias (ranches) of JesÃºs MarÃ­a and Santa Catalina, which were built by Jesuit missionaries, who had a devastating impact on the area's indigenous inhabitants in the 17th and 18th centuries. Centered on striking whitewashed churches, the estancias â listed as Unesco World Heritage sites â offer museums and guided tours that lead visitors through this complicated period in Argentinian history.

At the end of the Camino de la Historia, you'll reach a collection of caves and mountain slopes covered with beautiful petroglyphs near the pretty village of Cerro Colorado. Created up to 1000 years ago, these ancient artworks depict humans and animals, scenes from everyday life, and abstract shapes and figures, providing a snapshot of a lost world.

5. Ruta de los Siete Lagos
Best scenic drive
San MartÃ­n de los AndesâVilla La Angostura; 110km (68 miles); allow 1â2 days

Gorgeous landscapes reminiscent of the Alps, numerous options for side trips, plenty of places to grab a bite to eat or stay the night â with perks like this, a leisurely drive along the Ruta de los Siete Lagos (âSeven Lakes Routeâ) is hard to beat.

Connecting the tourist hubs of San MartÃ­n de los Andes and Villa La Angostura, the drive follows Ruta 40 through two national parks â LanÃ­n and Nahuel Huapi â taking in a particularly picturesque swathe of the Argentinian Lake District.

As youâd expect given the name, the highlights of the route are the seven eponymous lagos, which are lined with beaches, surrounded by dense forests and watched over by snowy mountains and volcanoes. All have crystal-clear waters that are ideal for swimming, kayaking or stand-up paddle boarding, though it may be hard to tear yourself away from the sublime views.

Planning tip: Snow can block off parts of the road in winter, so the Ruta de los Siete Lagos is best driven in the spring, summer or early fall.",

body: "Nowhere is perfect, but, letâs face it, Switzerland gets pretty darned close.

The Alps ripple across 60% of the country, and the landscapes and towns look like they have been dreamed up by a particularly imaginative child. Weâre talking glacier-capped peaks, crash-bang waterfalls, turreted castles of the fairy-tale kind and lakes in the most surreal shade of turquoise blue. Red trains curl up mountains to improbable heights, and clanging cowbells ring out across hilly meadows that you can skip down with Heidi-like glee.

Even the culture-filled cities have magnificent backdrops of vineyards, lakes or rivers, and the mountains are never more than a whisper away. As natural beauty goes, Switzerland is off the charts. It's also a joy to travel around, whether by train, bus or on a scenic road trip. Here are the best places to visit in Switzerland that will make your trip one to remember.

Get trusted guidance to the world's most breathtaking experiences delivered to your inbox weekly with our email newsletter.
1. Jungfrau region
Best place to experience the mountains

The idyllic Jungfrau region is the icing on the Alpine cake of Switzerlandâs Bernese Oberland. Sky-high peaks, glaciers and thundering falls elicit gasps of wonder wherever you go. Grazing the 4000m (13,123ft) mark are Switzerlandâs 'big three': Eiger (Ogre), MÃ¶nch (Monk) and Jungfrau (Virgin), enshrined in mountaineering legend.

Take a once-in-a-lifetime ride up to the everlasting snow at Europeâs highest train station, 3454m (11,332ft) Jungfraujoch. Hike, ski, sled and zip-line among mountains of myth in Grindelwald, enjoy waterfalls galore in Lauterbrunnen and tackle every kind of extreme sport imaginable in Interlaken (skydiving, ice climbing, glacial bungee jumping â you name it). The Jungfrau region is the great outdoors on a blockbuster scale.

Planning Tip: Rush this region and youâll regret it. Allow a week or more to dive in deep.

2. Bern
Best city for medieval flair

Bern often pops up in those I-canât-believe-itâs-the-capital trivia questions, but frankly, Switzerlandâs first city deserves more love. The cobbled, flag-bedecked medieval Old Town is a Unesco World Heritage treat, with 6km (3.7 miles) of covered arcades, cellar shops and bars, fantastical folk figures topping 16th-century fountains, and the eye-grabbing Zytglogge. Framed by wooded hills and split in two by the turquoise Aare River, this red-roofed city looks good from pretty much every angle. Itâs pure storybook stuff for kids, too, with its giant who snacks on children (the Kindlifresserbrunnen) and resident bears.

Sight-wise, youâll be drawn to big-hitters like the Einstein-Haus (where the genius developed his theory of relativity), the Kunsthaus (with its outstanding fine arts collection) and Renzo Pianoâs wavy Zentrum Paul Klee (Bernâs answer to the Guggenheim). But in summer, the actionâs on the water, with swimming, tubing, rafting and paddleboarding along the Aare River.

3. Lake Geneva
Best place for romance, vines and castles

In Switzerlandâs western crook, crescent-shaped Lake Geneva (Lac LÃ©man to Francophones) is a joy to behold, with its mountain backdrop, spirit-lifting views, vineyards and shoreline necklaced with handsome cities and castle-crowned towns.

Marked by its rainbow-kissed Jet dâEau fountain and Mont Blanc peeping up on the horizon, Geneva wraps around the lakeâs southern shore. The worldly city makes an excellent launchpad for exploring, with big-hitting museums and galleries to absorb, botanical gardens to stroll, lidos to swim at, Old Town cafes to hang out in and bright-yellow mouettes ferrying locals across the water â surely one of the worldâs most scenic commutes.

Planning Tip: But donât stop there. Itâs a quick boat or train hop to Lausanne, which can culturally give Geneva a run for its money, especially with its Plateforme 10 arts district, the lovely terraced vineyards of Lavaux (a Unesco World Heritage site) and flower-draped Montreux, host to one of the worldâs most famous jazz festivals, with the picture-perfect ChÃ¢teau de Chillon right on its doorstep.

4. Zermatt
Best place for outdoor activities

No peak has more pulling power than the 4478m (14,692ft) Matterhorn, a terrific gnarled fang of rock that flings up above the seductive, timber chalet-filled Alpine resort of Zermatt. It's Switzerlandâs mountain icon, so beloved by the nation that it inspired the pyramid shape of Toblerone chocolate.

Zermatt is more than a one-mountain wonder. Climbers have been rocking up here since the mid-19th-century, and itâs still a magnet for challenging summit ascents today. Otherwise, come to hike, ski and gaze over a sea of glaciers and 4000m (13,123ft) peaks at Matterhorn Glacier Paradise. 

5. Swiss National Park 
Best place for nature lovers

Switzerland has just one national park? Yes, we know itâs a shocker, but trust us, itâs a good one. Snuggled away in a remote corner of the countryâs southeast on the border with Italy, the 172-sq-km (66-sq-mile) Swiss National Park is the Alps in overdrive: a nature-gone-wild spectacle of high moors, forests, wildflower-freckled pastures, waterfalls, jewel-colored lakes and mountains as high as the sky, where ibex, chamois, marmots, deer and golden eagles roam and fly free.

Planning Tip: Start off on the right foot with the inside scoop on walking trails and ranger-led guided hikes at the visitor center in Zernez.

6. Bellinzona
Best place for la dolce vita

With medieval castles rising high and the Alps rearing beyond, good-looking Bellinzona is a taste of the best of Italy's best food and culture in Switzerland. Youâll find a generous splash of Italian flair in its historic center, woven with flower-draped alleys, Renaissance churches and cafe-rimmed piazzas that brim with life, laughter, clinking glasses and the out-of-tune toll of countless campaniles. 

Planning Tip: Top of any wish list is seeing the castles, among them hilltop Castelgrande, which can be drawn out into a full dayâs activity (bring water and comfortable shoes). 

7. Jura Mountains and Lac de NeuchÃ¢tel 
Best place for a remote road trip 

In the dark forested hills along the French-Swiss border, the Jura Mountains are a natural wonder. This peaceful region has a beauty all its own: meadows of green, ancient forests, rocky outcrops overlooking a trio of lakes against an Alpine backdrop and slow-paced villages and valleys little changed in centuries. 

Begin with a road trip. Kick off at the Jura Vaudois Nature Park for hikes with dress-circle views of Lake Geneva and GruyÃ¨re cheese tastings at rustic Alpine huts. Swing north to Lac de Joux, the watchmaking village of Le Sentier, and Vallorbe, honeycombed with Switzerlandâs biggest (and most impressive) limestone caves.

Tag on a trip to Lac de NeuchÃ¢tel and you can bathe in the thermal waters of Yverdon-les-Bains, tiptoe off the map in the lushly rolling Val-de-Travers (birthplace of absinthe) and the crescent-moon canyon of Creux du Van. Cultured NeuchÃ¢tel is a fitting climax, with its fantasy of a lavishly turreted chÃ¢teau.

8. Appenzell and northeastern Switzerland
Best place for family adventures

Northeastern Switzerland might not have the in-your-face drama of higher realms of the Alps, but it nevertheless delights in its own serene, deeply rural way, with dairy country unraveling to meet the mountains and half-timbered, gaily muralled towns all fit for a postcard. This pocket-sized region is perfect for a family vacation with a hit of culture and gentle adventure.

Begin in St Gallen, with a spin round its World Heritage Stiftsbibliothek (Abbey Library), a literary marvel and a feast of rococo art and architecture. Move on to folksy, ridiculously pretty Appenzell, popping into the SchaukÃ¤serei to sample regional cheeses.

Muscling further south into the Alps, head on up to SÃ¤ntis at 2501m (8205ft) for views embracing six countries and then go to Werdenberg, a tiny speck of a medieval hamlet, home to Switzerlandâs oldest timber chalets.

Planning Tip: Close by is Vaduz, Liechtensteinâs princely, castle-topped capital on the banks of the Rhine.

9. Lake Lucerne
Best place for lakeside romance

Reclining on the shores of its glittering namesake lake, Lucerne is a walkable, medieval dream of a city that has a magic you canât quite put your finger on. It will grab you when you are strolling along the promenade as the sun sets in a blaze of gold and pinks or as you cruise across its waters to mountains of myth: 2132m (6995ft) Mt Pilatus, where Wagner raved about the Alpine panorama and Queen Victoria trotted on horseback, and 1797m (5896ft) Rigi, with a light so sublime Turner painted it in three different moods.

The little city punches far above its weight culturally, with its iconic medieval KapellbrÃ¼cke bridge leaping across the Reuss River and the Jean Nouvelâdesigned KKL arts center and Sammlung Rosengart harboring a prized private collection of Picassos. Ambling past the belle Ã©poque hotels lining its shores, the same views that captivated Goethe, Queen Victoria and Wagner in the 19th century will hold you in their thrall.

Planning Tip: With more time on your hands, you can really get out on the lake. Cruise across fjord-like, mountain-rimmed Lake Uri for a taste of Switzerlandâs geographical and spiritual heartland. Boats ply the glassy turquoise waters to RÃ¼tli, birthplace of the Swiss nation.

10. Basel
Best place for art lovers

Popularity wise, poor old Basel barely gets a look. But thatâs a mistake. Straddling the Rhine, this city has everything going for it: world-class art in some of the countryâs best galleries, a hot food scene, avant-garde buildings bearing the hallmark of Pritzker Prizeâwinning architects and an upbeat cafe culture.

Allow several days for a satisfying romp of the center, where must-sees include the Kunstmuseum and its fine arts collection, the Renzo Piano-designed Fondation Beyeler and the Frank Gehry-designed Vitra Design Museum.

Planning Tip: Basel endears itself most to those who look beyond the trophy sights, with sundown drinks by the river or a wild swim in the Rhine. Rent a Wickelfisch (a fish-shaped waterproof bag) at the tourist office, strip to your swimming suit and go with the flow, floating downstream past the cityâs landmarks.

11. ZÃ¼rich
Best place for urban culture

Regularly landing at the top in quality-of-living surveys, urban dynamo ZÃ¼rich never seems to miss a beat: from cool waterside bars on the banks of the Limmat River to its alley-woven Old Town, where the twin-spired Romanesque GrossmuÌnster shines with Augusto Giacomettiâs rainbow of stained glass. Le Corbusierâs boldly colored architectural creations and the edgily post-industrial ZÃ¼ri-West neighborhood notch ZÃ¼rich's culture cred up even further.

Planning Tip: In mid-August, ZÃ¼rich throws one of Switzerlandâs wildest parties: the techno-pumping Street Parade.",

seven_day_journey_trans_bhutan_trail = Blog.create!(title: "7-day journey on the Trans Bhutan Trail", 
body: "Historically a pilgrimage route, the fully-restored Trans Bhutan Trail reopened to visitors in September 2022. Its 250 miles of scenic footpath will offer visitors a unique perspective of the Asian country and likely will become one of the worldâs most iconic cross-country walks.

To do the trek, you have to hire a guide who will lead you along this spectacular trail. We asked guide Galey Tenzin to give us an idea of what you might experience over seven days on the Trans Bhutan Trail. 

best-in-travel-2023-bhutan-itinerary-intro.png
A tour guide for more than a decade and a German-language guide for more than five years, I have explored every corner of my country of Bhutan. I have been involved in the reopening of the Trans Bhutan Trail from the first discussion of the project through restoration of the trail up to the first traversal of its 250-mile (403km) length in almost 60 years. I must say it is truly one of the best trekking destinations ever, allowing one to refresh and reconnect with nature.

Snapshot-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
Why you should trek the Trans Bhutan Trail 
The Trans Bhutan Trail is an ancient route through the Himalayas that lets you follow in the footsteps of our ancestors. For hundreds of years, the trail was used by pilgrims, messengers, armies and traders â and until the 1960s, it was the only way to travel through and communicate with others across the country. After Bhutan initiated a process of planned development beginning in the 1960s, a national highway was constructed and the trail fell into disuse. Under the vision of the king of Bhutan, the Bhutan Canada Foundation together with the Tourism Council of Bhutan and other local partners are currently working to restore and reconnect this historic route. To mark the launch of the restored trail in September 2022, a national event had 24 scouts â one from each dzongkhag (district) and four from each thromde (city), representing the entire country â walk the length of the trail in a show of national unity. I led this scout walk for the full 250 miles, from Haa east to Trashigang. 

The trail offers exposure to unique culture, multiple dialects, different religious sites and varied flora, fauna and birds â as well as a range of campsites, farm houses, hotels and unique foods. Scenic views and conversations with local people make it even more pleasant and rejuvenating. One can hike through the trail at any time of the year, with each season offering a different experience. (Note that the trail sees snowfall during the winter months, and muddy, challenging conditions in the summer monsoon season.) Visitor-friendly, the trail can be hiked in different sections, with a clear end point for each. QR-coded signposts provide links to texts and comic bookâstyle illustrations that explain the history of each area. 

A note: the itinerary outlined below should be relatively easy for those who do regular physical exercise (and no problem at all for trekkers), and moderately demanding for those who go for frequent casual walks. Consider your own physical fitness and health level: we do not recommend this itinerary if you have no experience hiking. All international hikers must be accompanied by a guide.

Day 1-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Arrival in Paro 
International flights serve Paro from Kathmandu, Delhi, Guwahati, Bagdogra, Dhaka, Singapore and Bangkok. Before you even step foot in Bhutan you will see what a dramatic land this is from the windows of your dragon-emblazoned Druk Air plane. As you make your descent from over the Himalayas, youâll enjoy one of the most scenic flights (and hair-raising landings!) youâve ever experienced.

The airport is situated at an elevation of 7333ft (2235m) in a dramatic valley, and you will feel cool, clean fresh mountain air the minute you disembark from the aircraft. Your tour guide will greet you and drive you to your hotel. After a Bhutanese lunch, youâll acclimatize to the altitude with an easy walk and tour of Paro. The National Museum once served as a watchtower (or ta dzong), originally built to defend the Rinpung Dzong during the inter-valley wars of the 17th century. A museum since 1967, it today holds a fascinating collection of art, relics, religious Thangka paintings and Bhutanâs exquisite postage stamps. Next, at the majestic Paro Dzong, you can light traditional butter lamps to bring success and safety on your journey to come. 

Admire the multi-colored wooden facades, small arched windows and sloping roofs of the typically Bhutanese architecture as your guide relates the story and importance of this dzong. (Some scenes from the 1993 internationally co-produced film Little Buddha were filmed here.) A short walk back toward Paro town takes you across a cantilever bridge that offers a splendid, photogenic evening view of the dzong and ta dzong. Then itâs back to your hotel for dinner.

Day 2-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Hike from Tsendona to Damchona
10 miles (16 km); 7 hours; 2900ft (884m) elevation gain, 1047ft (319m) elevation loss

A 10-minute drive brings you to the beginning of your Trans Bhutan Trail hike. This part of the trail connects three villages: Tsendona, where the trail begins before gently rising through rice fields; Dopshari, where you will stop for lunch; and Damchona, where you will camp overnight. Along the trail, you can take in beautiful views of the Paro Valley and its sights, as well as Kungkarpo, a sacred site for âsky burial.â Keep an eye out for mountain bikers, as this section also serves as a cycling trail â and for planes, too, as they bank overhead alongside the mountain on their final descent into Paro.

Lunch will be set up at Tshering Farm House in Dopshari, where youâll enjoy organic and traditional Bhutanese foods as well as a beautiful view of rice fields. After lunch, the trail climbs up slowly through the pine trees toward the campsite at Damchona, where apples rather than rice are the local crop, and locals rear cattle and horses. During monsoon season (JuneâAugust), count on meeting people foraging for wild chanterelle mushrooms. Upon your arrival at camp, you will be served a hot towel to clean up, followed by hot tea and dinner. When night falls and as the campfire crackles, your tour guide and trail ambassador will narrate the history of the trail.

Day 3-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Hike from Damchona to Tsaluna
10.75 miles (17.25 km); 6 hours; 2526ft (770m) elevation gain, 2664ft (812m) elevation loss

After breakfast at camp, youâll continue on the trail from Damchona to Tsaluna village. The trailâs rise is gradual and the path will be clear of debris thanks to the dozens of horses plying the route each day during trekking season. Tall trees and coniferous forests line the path until Jela Pass (11,575ft/3528m), where you can hoist lungdhar (prayer flags) while saying the prayer âLha-geh loâ (âMay the gods be victoriousâ). After Jela Pass, the trail drops gently through clusters of rhododendrons. After about 1.25 miles (2km), you will reach an open area thatâs a good spot for a picnic, with views toward Pumola and other mountain ridges â and the next section of the trail. 

From there, youâll walk through a settlement called Jadingkha, then through groves of beautiful pine and oak trees until Tsaluna. Along the trail you will hear the calls of such birds as the Himalayan monal, satyr tragopan, fire-tailed myzornis and hoopoe. (Expect a bit of mud, too, as cattle rearing is prevalent in this area.) Youâll be welcomed at your campsite, surrounded by pine trees, with warm evening tea and snacks. With locals, you can try your hand at archery (Bhutanâs national sport) in the ancient manner, using a bow made of bamboo. Your trail ambassador will join you for dinner, and provide a seal to authenticate your completion of this section of the trail. Then, next to the campfire, watch (or even help) the trekking cook prepare your Bhutanese dinner, which might include red rice, ema datsi (chili with cheese), suja (butter tea), momo (steamed dumplings), buckwheat noodles and other tasty dishes. 

Day 4-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Hike from Tsaluna to âBuddha Pointâ
12.2 miles (19.65km); 9 hours; 3930ft (1198m) elevation gain, 4308ft (1313m) elevation loss

Wake up to the sounds of birds chirping in the pine trees. Youâll start your day with a warm bedside tea served by the trekking crew, before packing up and taking breakfast. From the campsite, the trail ascends gradually, then drops into a steep slope lined with dense oaks. There is hardly any view on this trail â only the sounds of streams and birds. After 3 or 4 hours of walking, you will reach Pumola, where you can rest and relax near a huge stupa. Next, youâll ascend another steep slope for another 90 minutes up to the peak of Pumola, known locally as Thaptsakha and the highest point on the Trans Bhutan Trail. Along this section, amazing views of mountain ranges, monasteries and the Thimpu Valley will open up along a route that was onced used by messengers traveling between Paro and Thimpu. (Adventurous visitors can retrace that 29-mile/48km route via the Druk Path Trek.) You will have lunch at the peak of Pumola and also offer incense as a way to pay homage to our local deities.

After lunch, the trail descends through a magical landscape of open pastures where yaks graze; stop by a yak-herderâs camp to get a taste of nomadic life. As you get closer to the next section of the trail, you will get a closer view of Thimphu Valley and its famous Buddha statue. This section of the trail will end near this gigantic, 177ft(54m)-tall monument, and you wonât want to miss out on a photo opp in front of it. After so much walking, take a car to your hotel for a hot shower. Feel free to call it a night â or set out to explore small but lively Thimpu on foot.

Day 5-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Hike from Dochula to Simtokha
9.3 miles (15km); 7 hours; 3235ft (986m) elevation gain, 1729ft (527m) elevation loss

After breakfast at your hotel, youâll drive through from Thimphu to Punakha through the Dochula Pass â a must-visit stop for travelers. Here, colorful prayer flags line the road, with amazing, panoramic views of the snow-covered Himalayas forming a majestic backdrop against 108 chortens (Buddhist shines). After taking photos and hearing stories from your guide, youâll get out your hiking gear and prepare for your last day on the Trans Bhutan Trail.

The first hour will take you through beautiful rhododendrons and huge hemlock trees, before you drop down through a pine forest and some settlements along the way. (During the growing season from May to July, you will see farmers working their organic fields.) Youâll enjoy lunch below Hongtsho, sampling apples from local orchards as dessert. As you wind your way on to Simtokha, you will cross the same river seven different times. At the end of the hike, a trail ambassador will be waiting for you with tea, snacks and a signature for your Trail Passport to certify your completion of this leg of the journey. After driving back to Paro, youâll check in at Ughyen Farm House, where you can experience a hot-stone bath and enjoy scrumptious local Bhutanese food. A cultural program featuring mask dances, traditional folk dances and an archery demonstration concludes a full day.

Day 6-bit-2023-itinerary-bhutan.png
 
Tigerâs Nest hike
7.5 miles (12km); 7 hours; 2625ft (800m) elevation gain, 394ft (120m) elevation loss

No first-time trip to Bhutan would be complete without a visit to the Tigerâs Nest. Built on a cliff some 9840ft (3000m) above sea level, this extraordinary monastery is one of the most memorable holy sites in the world. Hikers can reach the site via a trail with a natural clay surface, one wide enough for people to walk comfortably. (Note that the trail can become dusty on dry days, and muddy and slippery on wet ones, especially on segments frequented by horses.)

After breakfast with suja (butter tea), youâll head from the farm house to the Tigerâs Nest âbase camp,â where you can use the facilities and buy walking sticks for your hike. (Horses and ponies are available for hire for those unable to hike.) After a 2-hour ascent, you can stop for a bit at the rest area, which has a cafeteria offering tea and food â as well as a view up to the monastery. From the cafeteria, a direct-ascent trail joins the main path after a few hundred meters, saving you backtracking. The main trail continues upward steadily, with a few shortcuts offering a (steep and often slippery) way to save some time; youâll have excellent views of the monastery throughout.

The path then enters forest again until you reach the traverse trail, which will lead you on a gentle ascent. Along the way you will pass an area where bigger groups sometimes stop for lunch, and the temple at which the former Je Khenpo (head lama) of the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyu school of Tibetan Buddhism was born. Finally, you will reach the viewpoint, where the majestic sight of Tigerâs Nest monastery will open just in front of you. Though most people stop here for photographs, the best photo spot is about 164ft (50m) farther down, beside a short prayer wheel.

Start descending by the steep concrete stairs down â very carefully, and holding on to the banister, as a misstep could be fatal. Even during the busiest part of the day from 10am to 1pm, when the stairs get jammed with tourists and Bhutanese pilgrims, remember to behave with respect since you are on sacred ground. After losing some 328ft (100m) of altitude, the stairway will lead into the gap between two cliffs below an impressive waterfall. After crossing the bridge, continue up the stairway to the right. This is the last 263ft (80m) of altitude gain before you reach your goal: the entrance to the monastery itself.

Please bear in mind that before you enter, your guide will need to clear you with the guards, and youâll need to leave your belongings in the lockers; no phones or cameras are allowed inside. What is to be seen and experienced in the monastery is beyond the scope of this article, and we will happily leave the backstory to your competent guide. We will simply reveal that while you sweated and panted on your hike up, the Guru Padmasambhava, the saint who established this place in 8th century, was brought here on the back of a flying tigress who turned out to be his spiritual consort and wife in different form (hence âTigerâs Nestâ). After your temple visit, follow the same way back down. Your lunch will be served at the cafeteria against a view of the temple and amid the sound of birdsong.

After your hike, spend a few hours exploring Paro town and picking up some local products as gifts or souvenirs of Bhutan before heading to your hotel. Since this will be your last day in the country, you can have a relaxing massage and enjoy your night in comfort.

Day 7: Himalayan Departure 
Over breakfast, youâll prepare to say goodbye to an amazing and extraordinary place. On the way to the airport, reflect on the warm-hearted people youâve met and the lasting memories youâve made â ones youâll keep for a lifetime. The Bhutanese will look forward to seeing you again in this land of endless enchantments. Tashi delek!",

thailands_top_six_train_journeys = Blog.create!(title: "Thailand's top 6 train journeys", 
body: "It's been over a century since Thailandâs first train line â a scant 50 miles linking Bangkok and the former royal capital of Ayuthaya â was completed. Tracks have since been extended to most of the country, and while train travel has almost entirely been superseded by bus and air, scenic railway routes and sleeper trains remain one of the best ways to see the country.

Even the Thai government can see the potential in railways again. Thereâs talk of high-speed rail lines, and Bangkokâs shiny new Bang Sue Grand Station is (allegedly) Southeast Asiaâs largest rail hub.

For now, Thailandâs rolling stock isnât that advanced, but trains run by the State Railways of Thailand (SRT) are generally on time, comfortable and charming in a stuck-in-time type of way. 

If youâre not in a rush, trains also offer good legroom (particularly in sleeper cars); great Thai food (either from the dining car or from vendors selling snacks between stations); gorgeous views; antique train stations; and quirky experiences (such as the route that appears to crash into a fresh market). Here are the six best train journeys in Thailand.

1. Mahachai Line
Start â Thonburi; End â Samut Songkhram; Distance â 50 miles/80km

One of the best train rides in Thailand is this short, workaday commuter line. It begins near Bangkok and famously terminates smack dab in the middle of a wet market. 

Start at Thonburiâs Wongwian Yai train station, just across the Chao Phraya River from Bangkok, where hourly trains go to Samut Sakhon (known by locals as Mahachai). From the window, you can peek into homes, temples and shops built just an armâs length from the passing trains. Further on, palm trees, patchwork rice fields and marshes filled with giant elephant ear perennials and canna lilies line the route, punctuated by whistle-stop stations.

The farmland evaporates as you enter Samut Sakhon. After disembarking and walking through one of the most hectic fresh markets in the country, youâll reach a harbor clogged with water hyacinths and wooden fishing boats. 

Take the ferry across to Baan Laem, where you'll board yet another train, this time for  Samut Songkhram. Youâll emerge directly into a hubbub of hectic market stalls. Between train arrivals and departures, these stalls are set up directly on the tracks and must be hurriedly cleared away when the train arrives. Itâs a fantastic scene.

2. Death Railway
Start â Thonburi; End â Nam Tok; Distance â 258 miles/415km

Built during the WWII Japanese occupation of Thailand, the so-called Death Railway is Thailandâs most famous â and historic â train line. Construction began in October 1942, by Allied prisoners of war (POWs) and conscripted workers armed only with basic tools and dynamite. Well over 12,000 POWs and as many as 90,000 recruited and forced laborers died due to disease, poor hygiene, lack of medical equipment and brutal treatment by camp guards. The deadliest section of railway construction was an immense rock cutting dubbed âHellfire Passâ because of the eerie glow of their torches, visible when working at night.

Given the rugged territory it passes through, this is undoubtedly the most scenic train trip in Thailand. A total of 688 bridges were built along the route; the bridge that spans the âRiver Kwaiâ near Kanchanaburi city (now referred to as the Death Railway Bridge) was, at the time, the only steel bridge built in Thailand.

The trains that run the Death Railway are 3rd-class, meaning they have no air-con and mostly wooden benches (sit on the left-hand side for the best views). Itâs a tourist line today, so there are stops for short visits to historical sights and a cave.

3. Sleeper Train to Chiang Mai
Start â Bangkok; End â Chiang Mai; Distance â 467 miles/751km

Thailandâs first long-distance train route, which links Bangkok and the northern city of Chiang Mai, is the classic Thai train journey. 

The route is a great chance to try one of Thailandâs sleeper trains. They depart Bangkok starting in the afternoon, which means the majority of the journey is at night. In the morning, youâll wake up to beautiful glimpses of the northern Thai countryside. In particular, keep your eyes peeled as the train cuts through tunnels and the rugged forest of Doi Khun Tan National Park, just south of Chiang Mai (another fascinating sight is watching railway staff unfold and make the sleeper beds).

If you book a more expensive ticket, youâre likely to travel on one of the SRTâs shiny new trains. Likewise, purchase your tickets as far in advance as you can; this particular route is popular with tourists, especially backpackers.

4. Beach Train
Start â Bangkok; End â Hua Hin; Distance â 131 miles/212km

This route skirts around the Gulf of Thailand, and although sea views are rare, in Phetchaburi and Prachuap Khiri Khan Provinces, thereâs some beautiful scenery, including salt flats and seemingly never-ending coconut plantations. Your destination, Hua Hin, is Thailandâs original beach escape, with a history that dates back to the 19th century.

The highlight of the route is Hua Hinâs train station. Arguably the most beautiful train terminus in Thailand, this red-and-white icon was built in 1926 with a Victorian gingerbread design boasting lots of carved wood pillars and trim. Because Hua Hin owes its prosperity to the train, the station is a major source of pride, and you'll find imitations of its design all over town.

5. Night Train to Laos
Start â Bangkok; End â Thanaleng; Distance â 402 miles/648km

Departing from Bangkok in the afternoon, this lauded international route crosses the Mekong River into Laos and is a great opportunity to try out Thailandâs overnight sleeper trains. In the morning, with warm sunlight streaming into your bed, youâll pass by the tiny villages and seemingly endless rice fields that make up Thailandâs rural northeast.

After a stop in Nong Khai, youâll cross the so-called Friendship Bridge to Laos. The 15-minute ride drops you at Thanaleng (aka Dongphasay) station, meaning youâll need to take a taxi or tuk-tuk the remaining 10 miles to the capital, Vientiane.

A high-speed train linking these two destinations is in the works, with its projected completion in 2028.

6. Eastern & Oriental Express
Start â Bangkok; End â Singapore; Distance â 1100 miles/1800km

Finding the SRT dining car menu a bit lacking? Then consider a trip on the ultra-luxury Eastern & Oriental Express, a privately-operated train that links Bangkok and Singapore. Outfitted to recall the golden era of train travel, passengers on the three-night, four-day journey reside in sumptuous private cabins, although they may also find themselves spending much of their time in the Observation, Dining and Bar Cars. 

The journey is all-inclusive, and non-train activities include tours and excursions in Thailand and Malaysia. The E&O runs between Bangkok and Singapore twice a month.

Tips for buying train tickets in Thailand
You can buy train tickets online via the clunky SRT website, but if youâre in Bangkok, itâs much more efficient to head directly to Hualamphong Station and purchase tickets in person. 
Avoid touts in and around the station, who will try to redirect you to travel agencies.",

body: "Asmall country that's big on hospitality, ancient history and culture â with numerous Unesco World Heritage sites â Jordan offers endless opportunities for adventure.

From afar, itâs often unfairly lumped in with regional conflict and, as such, overlooked by timid travelers. But in reality, itâs a welcoming and peaceful destination not to be missed. Donât hesitate to book your trip, pack your bags and check out these things all first-time visitors should know before they travel to Jordan.

Make the most out of every adventure with help from our weekly newsletter delivered to your inbox.

Jordan is a safe place to visit
Despite being located in a region with a history of conflict, Jordan is the 'quiet house in the noisy neighborhood,' a friendly oasis thatâs open and inviting to visitors. Hospitality reigns supreme, violent crime is extremely rare, and Gallupâs 2022 Law and Order Report ranks Jordan in the top 10 for countries where people feel safe walking alone at night. While you should take the usual precautions you would anywhere â purchase travel and health insurance, donât carry large sums of cash, keep valuables locked in a safe â fear should not be a factor in planning a trip to Jordan.

Hospitality is a deeply rooted tradition
Donât let the 'Jordanian frown' fool you. Although you may be met with furrowed brows and what appear to be unfriendly faces, youâll quickly learn just beyond the tough exterior of a resting frown face typically lies a fun-loving attitude and a deeply rooted tradition of hospitality that can be traced back to Bedouin culture. Itâs not uncommon to be invited for tea or even a meal by shopkeepers and strangers you meet. 'Ahlan wa sahlan' (welcome), locals will say. 'Where are you from? Welcome to Jordan.'

When greeting someone, follow their lead
Youâll see people of the same gender greet each other with handshakes, hugs and even multiple air kisses beside each cheek. But if you put your hand out for a shake or lean in for a hug, you may be left hanging. Out of respect for their religion and spouse, some Muslims will not touch people of a different gender unless they are related by blood. Donât take it personally; be prepared and open to learning the local traditions. When meeting someone, you can stand, say hello, smile and then let them take the lead. If they extend a hand or lean in for a hug, you can do the same. If they keep their hands at their sides or put their right hand over their heart rather than reaching out, thatâs their way of acknowledging you.

Itâs not always hot and sunny in Jordan
A common misconception about Jordan is that itâs always hot, dry and sunny. While that may be the case if you visit between May and September, Jordan does have a winter season. From November to February, the country receives a great deal of cold and cloudy days, rain and even snow, sleet and hail on occasion. Temperatures can hover in the single digits Celsius during the day and drop to freezing in the night (32ÂºF), so if youâre traveling from mid-October to mid-March, be sure to pack a waterproof jacket and warm layers and monitor the weather. Flash floods are extremely dangerous, and even Petra is known to close during inclement weather.

Alcohol is legal, but heavily taxed
If youâre in search of sundowners, you can find alcohol at a number of restaurants, bars and, of course, liquor stores in the larger cities like Amman and Aqaba, as well as Christian towns such as Madaba and Fuheis (where youâll find Carakale, Jordanâs first and only craft beer microbrewery). St George and Jordan River also produce their own wine in the country, but be prepared to pay a pretty penny for your libations â although legal, alcohol tends to carry hefty taxes.

Bear in mind that Muslim-owned properties and Islamic holidays may affect how readily alcohol is available. For example, itâs illegal to sell alcohol anywhere in the country during Ramadan (with the exception of some high-end hotels), and most camps in Wadi Rum donât serve alcohol at all (but you can often bring your own). Call ahead to inquire on availability and any restrictions, and if you do drink, be mindful of your hosts and consume in moderation.

Dress respectfully
Jordan is a Muslim-majority country, but Christians, Jews and people of various beliefs also coexist peacefully here. There is no law requiring women to wear hijab, but there is an expectation to dress respectfully â itâs best to avoid low-cut and shoulder-baring tops, short skirts, and shorts. If you plan to visit a place of worship, both men and women must cover knees and shoulders, and women are typically expected to cover their hair, chest and neck. 

But covering up doesnât mean dressing down: Jordanians are generally quite image-conscious and well-dressed. Some restaurants even enforce a sophisticated dress code, particularly in Amman. Keep that in mind when loading up your suitcase and feel free to flaunt your personal style (respectfully) if youâll be spending time in the capital.


Smoking shisha and cigarettes is common
Alcohol may be in somewhat short supply, but there is argeeleh (shisha) aplenty. For better or worse, smoking shisha is a national pastime, and youâll find argeeleh cafes across the country. Cigarette smoking is also widely accepted â in most restaurants, cafes, hotels, homes, shops, taxis and even some hair salons. Travelers who smoke will be in good company, but the smoking culture in Jordan can prove challenging for nonsmokers and those with health conditions. When booking rooms, tours, restaurants and transportation, ask whether non-smoking options are available.

Bring a reusable filtration water bottle
Tap water is not drinkable in Jordan, and environmental education and recycling facilities are scarce. Sadly, you will see plastics and other rubbish littering the otherwise lovely landscapes. Local businesses and organizations with an eco-aware approach and plastic-free policies like those of Feynan Ecolodge, the Jordan Trail and Eco Hikers are working to teach and inspire locals and visitors with their environmental initiatives. Travelers to Jordan can be part of the solution by supporting these eco-minded businesses and carrying their own reusable filtration water bottle (such as GRAYL) and reusable utensils.

Jordan is proof that big things come in small packages
Jordan is smaller than Portugal or the US state of Maine, but within its borders youâll find endless adventure possibilities, ancient history and culture, nature reserves, community-based immersive experiences (such as those provided by Baraka Destinations, Engaging Cultures and Experience Jordan) and five Unesco World Heritage Sites, including the architectural wonders of Petra and the expansive deserts and towering rocks of Wadi Rum.

If youâre eligible for a visa on arrival to Jordan, purchase the Jordan Pass to gain entrance to some of the best sites, castles and museums including Petra, Wadi Rum, the Temple of Hercules in Amman, the Roman ruins at Jerash and Ajloun Castle. Keep in mind that although Jordan is small in size, the terrain is varied, roads may be rough and traffic can delay your plans. Traveling to sites may take more time than you anticipate, so plan accordingly and try not to schedule every moment of your itinerary. Immerse yourself in the experiences and allow time for the unexpected. 

Youâre going to fall in love with Jordan
Maybe it will be the moment you fall asleep under a blanket of stars or stand in awe of enormous ancient stones. Or perhaps it will hit you when you reach the peak of a mountain and take in the view, far away from the rush of the city. It might be the laughter and stories you share with your new Bedouin friends. Or the taste of tea brewed with sage and sugar over a campfire. It could be in the fresh mansaf (the Jordanian national dish of lamb, rice and yogurt sauce) made with love by your hosts and eaten with your hands. Or it could be when you hear the muezzinâs call to prayer while watching birds dive and swoop against a sunset sky.

There will be a moment â or more likely, many moments â when the magic of Jordan seeps into your soul. Jordan will welcome you, challenge you, and it may very well change you. And youâll find yourself making plans for your next trip before you even finish your first.",
